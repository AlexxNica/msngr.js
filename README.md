## What is msngr.js?
msngr.js is a small library for facilitating communication between components through abstract messages within the same application be it server or client side. It also provides binding messages directly to DOM elements and even sending payloads between browser tabs / windows.

The following example shows how to bind a message to a click event of a DOM element while gathering up the values in the related inputs for payload delivery.

```HTML
<input type="text" name="Username" value="Kris" />
<input type="password" name="Password" value="hunter2" />
<button>Submit</button>
```

```javascript
msngr("User", "Save")
    .bind("button", "click")
    .option("dom", ["input"])
    .on(function (payload) {
        console.log(payload.Username); // Prints "Kris"
        console.log(payload.Password); // Prints "hunter2"
    });
```
